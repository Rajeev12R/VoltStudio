        content: `
          <p class="mb-6">With the new year underway, you may be wondering what strategies you should implement for maximum SEO success in 2025. In this week’s episode of Whiteboard Friday, Chima Mmeje talks through her six top SEO tips for this year, which include driving brand awareness and diversifying your traffic sources.</p>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Create Brand Awareness to Drive Branded Searches</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">Brand is going to be absolutely critical for success in 2025. Use SEO to support your brand goals by creating brand awareness to drive branded searches. Track branded searches in tools like Moz Pro to measure the effectiveness of your efforts.</p>
          <p class="mb-6">To increase brand awareness, leverage social media, digital PR, sponsorships, promos, outdoor advertisements, and paid media. SEO should work in tandem with these channels to amplify your brand’s reach.</p>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Diversify Your Traffic Sources</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">With AI Overviews impacting organic search results, diversifying your traffic sources is essential. Repurpose content across multiple channels to maximize its reach. For example, turn a webinar into blog posts, social media videos, and email campaigns.</p>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Optimize for AI-Generated Results</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">While Google claims there’s no way to optimize for AI search, SEOs are experimenting with strategies to rank in AI Overviews. Analyze what’s ranking in AI Overviews using tools like Moz’s STAT, and align your content with search intent.</p>
          <p class="mb-6">Make your content easy to read, include multimedia, statistics, and expert quotes, and optimize for natural language to improve your chances of appearing in AI-generated results.</p>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">4. Encourage User-Generated Content (UGC)</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">User-generated content is a powerful way to build authenticity and trust. Encourage your audience to leave reviews on platforms like Trustpilot and Capterra. Avoid manipulating reviews on platforms like Reddit or Quora, as this can backfire.</p>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">5. Leverage Niche Influencers</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">Collaborate with niche influencers in your industry to amplify your brand’s reach. Influencers like Lily Ray and Mike King in the SEO space are trusted by both Google and their audiences, making them valuable partners for your campaigns.</p>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">6. Track Referral Traffic from LLMs</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">Use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to track referral traffic from AI platforms like ChatGPT and Gemini. This data will help you understand how AI search impacts your traffic and where to focus your efforts.</p>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">SEO in 2025 is all about building your brand and diversifying your strategies. By focusing on brand awareness, repurposing content, optimizing for AI, and leveraging UGC and influencers, you can stay ahead of the curve and achieve SEO success.</p>

        title: "Keyword Cannibalization: What it is and How to Fix it",
        content: `
          <p class="mb-6">You’ve worked hard to create SEO-friendly, user-focused content, but instead of higher rankings, multiple pages compete for the same keyword. Your best content gets buried, visitors land on less relevant pages, and your rankings and conversions take a hit.</p>
          <p class="mb-6">Keyword cannibalization happens when your content works against you. It confuses search engines, dilutes your authority, and hurts your rankings. In this article, I’ll show you how to identify and resolve keyword cannibalization issues so you can protect your rankings and drive more conversions.</p>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What is Keyword Cannibalization?</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">Keyword cannibalization occurs when multiple pages on your site target the same keyword and search intent, creating confusion for search engines. It makes it harder for search engine bots to determine the most relevant page, leading to lower-quality pages competing with your best content.</p>
          <p class="mb-6">For example, imagine you search for "email marketing" on Google and find several blog posts from the same site targeting that keyword. Which one would you click? This overlap creates competition between the site’s pages, causing fluctuations in search rankings and frustrating users.</p>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why is Keyword Cannibalization Bad for SEO?</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">Keyword cannibalization negatively impacts your site in several ways:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Decreased Organic Rankings and Traffic:</strong> Search engines struggle to identify the most relevant page to rank, leading to fluctuations and reduced traffic.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Wasted Crawl Budget:</strong> Search engines allocate a crawl budget for each site. Cannibalized pages waste this budget, delaying the indexing of more important pages.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Loss of Valuable Internal Link Equity:</strong> Internal links become fragmented, reducing the authority signal passed to the preferred page.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Difficulty Identifying Underperforming Pages:</strong> Traffic is spread across multiple pages, making it harder to identify which ones need optimization.</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How to Discover Keyword Cannibalization</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">Here are three steps to identify keyword cannibalization issues on your site:</p>
          <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Use Moz’s Pro Keyword Explorer Tool:</strong> Analyze your search rankings to identify potential keyword cannibalization.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Check Google Search Console:</strong> Use the Performance menu to see which pages rank for the same keywords.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Use the Site Search Operator:</strong> Use the "site:yourdomain.com keyword" search operator to find pages targeting the same keyword.</li>
          </ol>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How to Fix Keyword Cannibalization</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">Here are five ways to resolve keyword cannibalization:</p>
          <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Consolidate and Redirect Cannibalized Pages:</strong> Combine multiple pages into one authoritative page and set up 301 redirects.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Use Canonical Tags:</strong> Tell search engines which page should be indexed and ranked as the primary page.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Target Different Search Intents:</strong> Revamp each page to target a different search intent.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Build Links and Optimize Your Preferred Pages:</strong> Use internal links, backlinks, and content optimization to boost the authority of your preferred page.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Avoid Deleting or Noindexing Pages:</strong> Deleting or noindexing pages can harm your SEO performance.</li>
          </ol>
  
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">Keyword cannibalization can harm your SEO efforts, but with the right strategies, you can resolve it and improve your rankings. By consolidating pages, using canonical tags, and targeting different search intents, you can protect your rankings and drive more conversions.</p>
